### [LOG ENTRY: 0001]

DATE: [REDACTED]  
LOCATION: [REDACTED]  
STATUS: [REDACTED]

"This is Vera. First entry.  
I don't know if anyone will ever read this, but if I don't write it down, it’ll be as if none of this ever happened.

The city would prefer it that way. Omnia would prefer it that way.

I have 40 days. Forty days to cross Aethernum and return before my body stops working, before my suit runs dry, before I become another frozen monument in the dunes. Jiji and Momo are with me. They see what I see, say what I say , do what I ask . hopefully they can keep me sane here .  
  
This log isn’t for them. It’s for me. For proof. For something that won’t vanish when the wind erases my tracks.

I don’t expect to find answers, only the edges of something bigger. If  REDACTED speaks the truth, then Aethernum is not  lifeless.
