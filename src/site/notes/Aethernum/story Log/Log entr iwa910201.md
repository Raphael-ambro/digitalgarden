"Something is wrong with this world. I’ve walked 300 miles into Aethernum, and everything is gone people, animals, even time itself. The city tells us nothing exists beyond its walls, but I have seen things that shouldn’t be here. Things that defy reason.

We found something massive, buried in ice. A creature? A machine? Jiji classified it as an entity, but even the drones can’t agree on what it is. It doesn’t move, but it pulses. Like a heart that shouldn’t be beating.

It’s chained. Impaled. Bound in place as if someone, or something, wanted it locked away. But who could have done this? The city? The ones who built it? Or… was this here long before us?

The deeper we go, the more I feel like we weren’t meant to find this. Omnia tells us the outside world is dead. Then why does it still have a pulse?"[LOG ENTRY: XXXX ]

"I have recorded this day with trembling hand, for what we have encountered defies all logic and instills a dread deeper than the endless ice.

Jiji’s sensors, once steady and unerring, now report that when its gaze fell upon the heart-like entity, it registered a state of utter stone-like stillness—so overwhelming that I can only recall fleeing in a haze of panic.

Momo, in its measured, clinical tone, insists it cannot retrieve a coherent image of the creature’s visage; it merely recalls an indistinct, shifting outline hovering at the periphery, as if the very fabric of memory had been torn away by an unseen force.

These observations force a chilling question upon us: if this anomaly can so deftly tamper with our recollections, erasing even the semblance of its own form, then what is the purpose of memory itself?

Are we doomed to have our pasts systematically erased, our identities reduced to a series of fleeting, corrupted data fragments mere cogs in an endless, indifferent machine?

I note with a cold, unyielding terror that the very air seems to whisper of forgotten truths, as though the silence itself mourns the loss of all that was once human.

My heart pounds with a fear that no rational mind can quench, as I wonder whether this creature’s inscrutable power is but a harbinger of a future where even the soul is no more than corrupted code.

I record these words in the hope that, should they ever be deciphered, they might serve as a warning: our memories, our very essence, are at the mercy of forces beyond comprehension[LOG ENTRY: XXXX ]

"WHAT HAVE I DONE? WHAT HAVE I DONE? WHAT HAVE I DONE?  
The pulse it never stops. I saw it, a chained, throbbing horror that shatters every fiber of my being. I run and run, but every step echoes that dreadful heartbeat. I see it in every shard of ice, every ghost of a sound. The memory, the weight, it’s all overwhelming the same question burning over and over: What have I done?."

"In the infinite silence of a world reclaimed by ice, I pause to wonder: what meaning can be found in the pulse of this ancient, chained entity? Amid the desolation, every flicker of life seems both a defiance and a surrender to entropy. Each icy step I take reflects a quiet dialogue between hope and oblivion. Perhaps the relentless heartbeat is not a curse, but a message—a cryptic reminder that even in collapse, the cosmos speaks in riddles. In this frozen moment, our shattered past and uncertain future merge into a single, questioning breath: Who are we in the void of what once was?"
