### Earth xxxx  
© imot ethosphere    
The air was brittle, the cold so sharp it could split steel. The blizzard didn’t rage; it simply existed, a constant, unending presence that had stripped the world bare. darkness wrapped around everything, its muffling all sound, leaving only the biting cold and the endless storm. Everything was either white or black, the colors of a place that had forgotten life.

  
Vera stood at the foot of the collapsed skyscraper, her breath misting in the frigid air. The building’s metal frame speared upward, disappearing into the storm. Rust streaked the ice that clung to its broken edges. One of her drones, Momo, hovered nearby, its spotlight skimming the wreckage. The beam caught a shattered foundation, 

“Structure unstable,” Momo’s voice crackled in her ears. “No life signs. No remains detected.”

Vera sighed. Another empty building… The cold preserved everything. Yet not a single corpse of human or even animals in this world. 

To her right, the cliff dropped into a haze of wind and ice. Her second drone, Jiji, zipped toward the edge, its light cutting through the gloom. “Ruin located below,” it announced. “Area: 180 square meters. Depth: approximately 50 meters down.”

She jogged after it, boots crunching snow. “Jiji, slow down!”  
  

The drone paused at the cliff’s edge. Below, the storm thinned just enough to reveal shapes in the ice: a school bus on its side, wheels frozen mid-spin. Cars buried up to their hoods. And farther out, a house slumped under the snow, roof caved in like a crushed soda can.

Vera attached herself to Momo’s rope, the synthetic fiber taut against her back. The cold seeped through her suit, a slow, relentless creep that even the best technology couldn’t fully keep at bay. Jiji hovered beside her, its light casting long shadows that stretched and twisted in the storm. The beam illuminated the vast, empty space below, a cavernous drop into blackness. The light made the blizzard worse, reflecting off the ice and filling the air with a dizzying swirl of white.

She took the first step down, her foot finding the edge of the rope. The descent was slow, methodical, the only sound was the creak of the rope and the hum of Jiji’s engines. The world didn’t feel alive, it felt like a tomb, vast and silent and unyielding. And in it, Vera was just another small, fragile thing, clinging to the edge of existence.

She looked down, her breath visible even through the mask of her suit. The building’s edge disappeared into the darkness, and for a moment, she wondered what she was looking for. But the thought didn’t hold. It was swallowed by the cold, the silence, the endless, unchanging stillness of a world that had forgotten how to tell its stories.  
Vera's thoughts echoed in the stillness, and she mused  
  
"Objects don’t grieve. They just… outwait us"  
"Why do things linger when the hands that made them don’t?"  
"Is it mercy this endless cold? Or punishment… for outlasting what we were?"  
"...What’s colder? The ice… or the silence of a world that leaves no stories?"

  
  
Vera’s boots finally touched the ice once again, the crunch of her steps echoing in the stillness. The blizzard raged above the cliff, but the world felt quiet, as if the cold had muffled all sound.

“Moji, scan ahead,” she said, her voice steady but laced with a hint of weariness.

“And Slow down, Jiji!” Vera called out, her voice sharp. The drone paused, its light steady on the path ahead.

“Abandoned house ahead,” Momo said, its voice calm and detached. “There’s light snowfall here, but the snowpack above the cliff is unstable.”

Vera’s heart quickened. This was the first remnant she’d found that she could safely explore. She moved cautiously, her boots crunching against the ice.

“Be careful on your right,” Jiji warned late, making Vera step on uneven rocks .  
Vera grunt and sigh , she just said  “Momo, scan the surroundings. Jiji, light up the house.”

The drones obeyed, jiji lights illuminating the small, slumped structure. The roof was caved in, the walls cracked, but it was intact enough to offer shelter from the light snow of this area.. Vera approached the broken window, her gloved hands careful as she climbed through the jagged frame.

Inside, the house was frozen in time. Furniture stood rigid, encased in layers of ice. A dining table, its surface cracked; a sofa, its fabric torn and stiff; a television, its screen shattered. Vera’s breath fogged the air as she moved, her footsteps echoing in the silence.

Then she saw them books. They were stacked haphazardly on a shelf, their covers frozen, their pages yellowed. She reached out,

“Ovid’s Metamorphoses,” she murmured. “Faust. Thus Spoke Zarathustra… What is this?”

Jiji hovered beside her, its light casting long shadows across the room. “These are books,” it said. “For most of human history, books were humanity’s way of capturing the world in physical form, their thoughts, dreams, and failures.”

Vera turned, her eyes narrowing. “FairTax,” she said, her voice tinged with disbelief. “Is this their dream as well?”

JIJI  responded. “Well, to some extent, it’s not limited to fantasy or history, parody, or even tax policy. It’s all in books.”

Vera stared at the books, her expression unreadable. They were fragments of a world that no longer existed, remnants of lives that had been lived and lost.

Momo’s voice cut through the silence. “No signs of life or corpses in this area. Warning: avalanche in five minutes.”

  
Vera stood silently by the window, her gloved hand reaching out with cautious slowness. The glass,lay fragmented and frozen, its remnants clinging to the frame. As her fingers made contact, the fragile pane responded with a faint crack, the sound echoing softly in the stillness of the abandoned house.

The world outside was a blur of swirling snow and ice. Through the broken windows, momo still scanning the surrounding area .Jiji, meanwhile, hovered silently above Vera, waiting for her next move.

Suddenly, Momo's voice broke the silence, urgent yet calm. "1 minute…."

Vera's gaze lingered on the cracked glass for a moment before she turned away, her expression resolute. "…alright, let's go," she said, her voice steady and decisive.

With that, she moved swiftly  
  
Vera walked through the endless expanse of frozen sand dunes. The world stretched out before her ….an infinite grave, mile after mile of nothingness.. Beside her, Momo and Jiji moved silently, their lights dimmed to conserve power, their hum a steady accompaniment to the howling wind.

Then, in the distance, something broke the monotony of the horizon a straight, unbroken line of steel and wood, half-buried in the snow. Vera squinted, It was a railroad, the tracks gleaming faintly where the storm had cleared them.

“Moji, scan the tracks,” she said, her voice low and tired.

“Clear,” Momo replied. “No obstructions in range.”

They followed the railroad for what felt like hours, the rhythmic crunch of vera footsteps and the occasional creak of the tracks the only sounds in the vast silence. The storm began to clear, just enough to reveal the skeletal remains of  bridges in the distance. Its supports were shattered, the span broken and hanging.  
Moji “ no life detected” .  
  
Vera climbed to the second bridge, the rails guiding her through the storm. The tracks curved sharply, then stopped buried under a wall of snow and ice. A tunnel entrance collapsed. Only the arched roof of a train jutted out, its metal ribs exposed and crusted with rust.

Momo scanned the mound. "No life detected."

Jiji circled the exposed roof, light glinting off frost-sealed windows. "Train model: Pre-Collapse cargo transport. Modified for passenger transit." It paused. "Modification appears… improvised."

  
Vera wiped sweat from her brow, her glove smearing grime across her face.. Another dead end. Another empty relic. The tunnel was just rubble and snow, the train a fossil under ice.

Momo pivoted, its sensors humming. "Fast Scanning perimeter ." A pause. "Massive structure detected. 800 meters northeast."

Jiji angled its camera. "Clarify."

"Concrete. Steel. Layout matches urban infrastructure."

Vera turned. "Show me."

Momo projected a hologram, a skeletal outline of collapsed towers, their foundations buried in snow. A city, or what was left of one. Roads iced over. Buildings stripped to frames.

"No energy signatures. No movement."

"Of course not," Vera muttered. She stared at the ruins. Windows like empty eye sockets. Streets choked with drifts.

Momo’s light flickered. "Proceed?"

Vera didn’t answer. She stepped past the drones, her boots carving fresh tracks toward the city.  
  
The highway was choked with vehicles. Cars sat bumper-to-bumper under ice, windshields frosted opaque. A semi-truck lay on its side, trailer split open, crates spilling out frozen solid. A faded sign read NOW LEAVING HAVENBRIDGE, the letters cracked ,brittle, frozen in time. Vera stepped over a frozen puddle, ice snapping under her boot. Momo swept its light across the road. “No organic decay detected. No bodies.”

Jiji hovered near a bus, tires sunk in permafrost. “Vehicle interiors empty. No luggage. No personal items.”

Vera kept walking, shoulders hunched against the wind. The city loomed ahead skyscrapers stripped to steel frames, upper floors sheared off. Ice crusted every surface, 

They passed under a collapsed overpass. Chunks of concrete dangled from exposed rebar. Momo’s sensors whirred. “Structural instability: 89%.”

  

The street narrowed, flanked by sunking skyscrapers . moji scanning buildings left and right , once again the buildings are too dangerous for Vera to go in . years of exposure to blizz-  
BAM.

Lightning split the sky. Electric blue, jagged, lingering, searing the clouds. It struck a radio tower two blocks east. The structure lit up, wires glowing white-hot before snapping. Sparks rained down as they hit snow.

Momo’s lens zoomed. “No life signs confirmed. Energy surge localized to atmospheric discharge.”

Jiji pivoted toward the tower. “Recommend avoiding conductive surfaces.”

Vera kept moving. The lightning flashed again, closer now. It lit the street in stark flashes—ice turned to glass, shadows sharpened into hard lines. She stopped at the base of the tallest skyscraper, its facade pocked with blast marks. A lobby chair sat upright in the snow, cushion rotted to dust.

BAM.

The third strike hit the building’s spire. For a moment, the tower’s skeleton glowed blue, every beam and joint illuminated. Then darkness slammed back.

MOMO light flickered. “Scan complete. Conclusion: No survivors. No remains. No traces of recent activity.”

Vera stared at the chair. “Yeah,” she said. “Got it.”

Thunder rolled. The drones fell in behind her as she walked away , the only witnesses left to ask the cold for answers.  
  

  
They walked away from the city, the storm fading to a steady wind. Hours passed. Ice dunes gave way to a flat, endless white. Vera stopped at the edge of a frozen ocean. Waves stood frozen mid-crash, sharp and still. Beyond them, a glacier towered, its surface cracked and scarred by lightning.

Momo hovered at the ice’s edge. “Deploying underwater form. Estimated dive time: 47 minutes.” It dropped into a crack, vanishing beneath the surface.

Jiji turned toward distant mountains. “Scanning elevated terrain. ETA: 22 minutes.”

Vera sat, her back against a slab of ice. Cold seeped through her suit.

BAM.

Lightning struck the glacier. A thin line glowed where it hit.

Momo’s voice buzzed in her ear. “Lightning impact location recorded. Melt possible in 1–2 days near your position.”

“Momo, status update.”

“10 kilometers deep. 200 meters underwater. Dive time elapsed: 41 minutes. Water temperature: minus one. Near heat vents: 100 to 300. No life detected.”

Vera checked her wrist display. “None?”

“Confirmed. None.”

Another sigh came from Vera . She dropped her body to the snow, and lay back. The sky was flat and dark, no stars, just …..cold .

Silence.  
  

She shut her eyes. The ice groaned under her weight, a low, grinding rumble that vibrated through her bones. Cold seeped into her suit seams, sharp and unrelenting. Her thoughts drifted, untethered.

Vera: “What the hell am I searching for ?”

A beat of silence. Then static fizzed in her ear.

Jiji: “There’s something going on…”

Her eyelids fluttered. She didn’t respond. The wind hissed over the glacier, muffling Jiji’s voice.

Vera: “Was Omnia right? Was he lying?”

Jiji: “Vera? Vera? You copy?”

Her glove twitched, brushing snow. She stared at the sky, breath fogging the air. “There’s nothing…. just cold, barren dune snow.”

Jiji: “Vera!”

She jerked, “What? What something?”

Jiji: “It’s an anomaly. Fifty meters out. A sudden burst of energy in a straight line. And it’s 373 km north of you. Momo?”

Momo: “Yeah, copy that.”  
  
  
The frozen ocean gave way to razorback ridges of ice, their slopes sheer and pocked with crevasses. Vera moved methodically, her boots punching through crusted snow. Momo’s light carved a tunnel through the blizzard ahead, while Jiji’s scans painted a skeletal map on her wrist displaying red lines for drop-offs, blue for stable ice. Her prosthetic arm whirred faintly as it adjusted grip on her climbing axe, joints stiff from the cold.

Ahead, the land fractured into a labyrinth of cliffs. Jiji banked sharply, circling a fissure. “Anomaly’s origin point: 200 meters beyond this ridge.”

Vera nodded, breath fogging her eyes. “Then we go through it.”

  
Vera followed Jiji’s coordinates north, the drones flanking her. The terrain dropped into a maze of ice cliffs, their edges jagged and slick.

Vera: “Jiji, scan ahead.”

Jiji surged forward, its light carving a path through the gloom. Vera gripped a ledge, her right arm a matte-black prosthetic from elbow to fingertips digging into the ice as she rappelled down. Sparks spat where metal met frozen rock.

Momo: “Right side.” Its beam lit a crevasse yawning below her boots.

Vera adjusted her descent, silent.

Momo: “Cliff ahead. Three to five meters.”

She landed hard, knees buckling. A fissure gaped at her feet, its edges brittle.

Vera: “Light the path.”

Momo’s spotlight was fixed on the far wall. Vera backed up, her pulse syncing with the muffled tick-tick-tick of her suit’s internal clock. Hydraulics hissed in her prosthetic arm as it tensed, pressure building like a semi-truck gearing for a haul. She bent low, boots digging into snow.

Tick.

Her muscles coiled.

Tick.

The prosthetic’s joints whined, pistons priming.

Tick.

She ran.

Ice cracked under her sprint. The crevasse yawned. She leapt-  
  

Her boot skidded on black ice. Momo’s claw snapped out, clamping her forearm. The drone’s motors whined, hauling her onto solid ground.

Vera: “Thanks, Momo.”

Momo: “Be careful.”

  
Vera sliding down again finally seeing jiji and…  
light catching something massive ahead a cylinder lodged diagonally in the ice. Thick as a subway tunnel, its surface shimmered with a sickly green film, like oil on water. No smell. No heat signature. Just... there.

Vera: “What? What is that?”

Jiji hovered closer. “Diameter: 18 meters. Length unknown. Material and entity name remain unidentified.”

Vera: “Entity? What do you mean?”

A low hum vibrated through the ice. The entity rippled.

Jiji: “It’s pulsing.”

Vera: “Pulsing? So this thing is alive?”

Momo angled between her and the cylinder. “Don’t go below, it could be hazardous material.”

Jiji: “Pulse rate: steady at 50 per minute. Unusual for a creature this size.”

Vera stepped closer. The entity throbbed, light diffusing through it in waves. Momo’s beam traced a path along the cylinder’s curve.

Momo: “Pulse grows stronger in this direction.”

Vera upholstered her ice axe. “Let’s follow it.”  
  
The storm worsened as they pushed following this entity pulse. Lightning struck every few seconds, blue-white flashes burning the ice into Vera’s retinas. She ignored collapsed buildings, hollowed-out trucks, a subway station buried under glaciers none of it mattered. Only the pulse.

When they reached the source, the blizzard was still. They slide down toward this….creatures

  

Momo and jiji : “Scanning ahead.”

Vera: “Feather…?” feathers floating above defying gravity 

Jiji: “There are five entities surrounding one central one.”  
Fifth green cylinders surrounded those ONE entities at the center.  
Momo: “Total height unknown; it has two limb-like legs and appears to be chained. Scan failed , snow depth exceeds 1 km, and the gap measurement is disrupted by the entity.”  
Two legs, thick and anchored by chains . The creature’s upper body vanished into the storm’s ceiling. A spear the size of a tower pierced it, holes gaping where the metal tore through.

Vera: “Is that a heart?”  
Jiji: “Not beating, approximately 30 m wide. It seems to have an object piercing it, creating holes through the heart.”  
A spear the size of a tower pierced this heart, holes gaping where the metal tore through.

Momo: “Has multiple wings, unknown, wrapped by chain too.”  
Wings feathered, fractured—splayed from its…. Back or front, each bound by hundreds of smaller chains.

Static screeched as Momo drifted higher, toward the creature’s obscured upper half.

Vera: “Momo?”

Momo: “….”

  
  
Vera couldn’t move. Her lungs locked. She is right below this creature,, The heart’s glass sphere reflected nothing, just black voids where the spear’s holes bored straight down into the ice. Vertical. Endless. Her pupils dilated, straining to see into them, but there was no bottom, no edge, just a hunger that pulled at her gut.

Jiji: “Back off!”

Momo: “!”

She jerked, stumbled. The drones wrenched her arms, dragging her backward. The slope’s edge crumbled under her boots.

Momo: “Detecting an increase in feathers!”

Vera’s hand wouldn’t stop shaking. She clamped it over her chest, fingernails biting through her suit.

Jiji: “Acoustic anomaly detected. Frequency matches… a heartbeat.”

Vera (gasping, vision tunneling): “Wait… that’s not mine. Jiji, what did Corvin say again?”

Jiji : “Four paths stretch toward the heavens, yet only one leads to truth. The path before the spear is where silence reveals all.”

Vera: “Is there one of the green entities in front of the spear?”

Jiji: “Yes.”

Vera: “Fuck! Run!”  
The creature didn’t move. No twitch, no roar. Just the heartbeat thud… thud… thud pounding through the ice, through her boots, through her skull. The pressure built like a vise, her own ribs creaking as if her heart might rupture.

  
  

They ran as fast as possible . desperately climbed out the cliff .  
The blizzard roared back, wind hurling ice grit that scraped Vera’s face. She kept her head low, squinting through the storm as they followed the green entity pulsed ahead. Lightning struck the cliffs around them, each flash bleaching the landscape bone white snow. Momo led, scanning for drop-offs, while Jiji trailed, sensors flaring erratically.

BAM.

A strike shattered the ridge above. Debris rained down rocks, ice shards, splintered steel. Vera ducked, boots skidding as the avalanche thundered past. She didn’t look back. Neither did the drones.

Above the cliff, the spear-pierced heart shuddered. Its glass surface rippled, fractures rearranging into a dark, pupil-like void. The sphere tightened into an eye massive, unblinking. It observed their retreat. 

---

Miles later, the ground leveled into a cracked riverbed. The entity had vanished, swallow by the fog  
  

Jiji slowed, rotors stuttering.  
Jiji (blinking status light): [PriorityChannel_Request] [EncryptionKey: JIJI-0774 → JIJI-0774] [Subject: DataPacket_IntegrityCheck]

Momo (rapid beep sequence): [RequestReceived] [VerifyingCredentials…]

Jiji: [ResendPacket_Y/N?]

Momo: [Affirmative] [AccessGranted]

Jiji: “Anomaly detected. Rear quadrant.”

Momo swung around

Momo: “Scanning… No movement. No heat signatures.”

Jiji: “It was there. For 0.3 seconds.”

Momo: “Negative. Sensor logs show—”

Vera: “What’s wrong, Momo?”

A pause. The drones hung motionless, their lights carving overlapping circles on the ice.  
Momo (steady green pulse): [DataStream_End] [EncryptionKey_Expired] [Channel_Closing]

Jiji (double beep): [Acknowledged] [TerminatingLink]

  

Momo: “…Nothing.”

Vera stared into the storm, the cold needling the back of her neck. The wind howled.

Jiji: “Recommend proceeding. Cold-front intensifying.”

They moved.

Behind them, the eye lingered, its gaze drilling into the storm.  
  
  

They walked for two days. The entity’s pulse led them through ice fields that never changed.

Momo: “Distance covered: 200 miles. Elapsed time: 48 hours.”

Vera’s glove brushed empty air then stopped. Her fingers splayed against nothing. She pressed harder. Resistance, cold and unyielding. Ahead, snow swirled normally, but her hand hovered midair as if braced on glass.

Vera: “What the hell…?”

Momo ascended, thrusters whining. At 30 meters up, it halted, light reflecting off an invisible surface. Jiji drilled downward sparks spat as its bit ground against the same barrier.

Vera: “Look at these giant glass walls!”

Jiji: “Measurement failed. Likely encircles the entire area.”

The green entity ahead rippled, passing through the wall. Vera clenched her lips.Vera (breathing hard): Vera (breathing hard): “Momo, help me crack this one!”

Her left arm shuddered servos whirring as plates shifted. Reinforced alloy segments locked into place, exposing plasma coils that glowed dull orange. A fuel port hissed open near her elbow.

Momo: “Affirmative. Engaging 40-year fuel reserve.”

The drones clamped onto her shoulder, fuel lines snaking into the port. The coils flared white-hot. Fire engulfed her arm, swirling from fingertips to shoulder a contained inferno roaring with Momo’s injected hydrogen.

Vera (gritting teeth): “More! Reserve only one year’s fuel!”

A pause. Momo’s joints hissed, throttling the flow.

Momo: “…Request accepted.”

Jiji: “Acknowledged.”

The fire condensed into a spear-like beam. Vera swings her arm forward as far as her body can go. The wall screeched ice and metal vaporizing on contact. The barrier rippled, cracks spider webbing outward.

Vera (strain sharpening her voice): “Damn, barely broke it!”

  

The breach hissed, edges still molten. Two meters wide. Vera squeezed through, suit steaming as the cold met the furnace-blast on the other side.

Her thermal readout spiked red. 140c. 160. 190.

Momo: “Atmospheric shift critical. Suit integrity at 43%.”

Jiji: “Gravitational anomalies detected. Local physics… inconsistent.”

The world here was a forge. Molten rivers cut through black rock. Above, floating islands hovered jagged masses of stone dripping lava into the void. The sky was a starless dark, no fog, no blizzard. Only lightning. Red-orange bolts, thicker than skyscrapers, lashing the horizon. Each strike lasted minutes, clawing across the blackness like glowing scars.

Vera (choking on heat. Her suit and body adjusting to the extreme change of condition): “What is this…?”

Momo: “No match to known astral charts. Radiation spikes suggest non-local spacetime.”

Jiji: “Entities detected. Same classification as prior.”

They were everywhere. Winged shapes, colossal and indistinct, gliding between the islands. No chains. No spears. Just shadows wreathed in heat-haze, their wingspans warping the air like mirages.

A red-orange lightning strike froze mid-arc. In its afterglow, the creature materialized three meters left of Vera. Wings folded tight around its body, a cocoon of charred feathers and shifting void. Heat radiated off it in waves, warping Momo’s sensors into static.

  
  

Another lightning strike. The bolt lingered, red-orange light etching the creature’s silhouette into the air a thing of jagged angles and hollows, wings swallowing all reflection.

Then the light died.
