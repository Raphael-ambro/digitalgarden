NOTE: This narrative has been reconstructed from 21020 fragmented data. Gaps filled via predictive algorithms. Emotional coherence: LOW.

The air was brittle.  
The cold was cold was cold was ■■■■■■■■■■ sharp it could split steel.  
The blizzard didn’t rage; it simply existed, a constant, unending presence that had stripped the world bare. [1]  
Darkness wrapped around everything, muffling all sound, leaving only the biting cold and the endless storm.  
Everything was white or black, the colors of a place that had forgotten life.  
![Still 2025-03-26 052550_1.1.1.png](/img/user/Still%202025-03-26%20052550_1.1.1.png)
Vera stood at the foot of the collapsed skyscraper, her breath misting in the frigid air. The building’s metal frame speared upward, disappearing into the storm. Rust streaked the ice that clung to its broken edges. One of her drones, Momo, hovered nearby, its spotlight skimming the wreckage. The beam caught a shattered foundation,  

“Structure unstable,” Momo’s voice crackled in her ears. “No life signs. No remains detected.”  

Vera sighed. Another empty building… The cold preserved everything. Yet not a single corpse of human or even animals in this world. [2]  

To her right, the cliff dropped into a haze of wind and ice. Her second drone, Jiji, zipped toward the edge, its light cutting through the gloom.  

“Ruin located below,” Jiji announced. “Area: 180 square meters. Depth: approximately 50 meters down.”  

She jogged after it, boots crunching snow. “Jiji, slow down!”

Vera sighed. Another empty building… The cold preserved everything. Yet not a single corpse of human or even animals in this world. To her right, the cliff dropped into a haze of wind and ice. Her second drone, Jiji, zipped toward the edge, its light cutting through the gloom.

 “Ruin located below,” Jiji announced. “Area: 180 square meters. Depth: approximately 50 meters down.”

She jogged after it, boots crunching snow. “Jiji, slow down!”  
  
The drone paused at the cliff’s edge. Below, the storm thinned just enough to reveal shapes in the ice: a school bus on its side, wheels frozen mid-spin. Cars buried up to their hoods. And farther out, a house slumped under the snow, roof caved in like a crushed soda can.

Vera attached herself to Momo’s rope, the synthetic fiber taut against her back. The cold seeped through her suit, a slow, relentless creep that even the best technology couldn’t fully keep at bay. Jiji hovered beside her, its light casting long shadows that stretched and twisted in the storm. The beam illuminated the vast, empty space below, a cavernous drop into blackness. The light made the blizzard worse, reflecting off the ice and filling the air with a dizzying swirl of white.

She took the first step down, her foot finding the edge of the rope. The descent was slow, methodical, the only sound was the creak of the rope and the hum of Jiji’s engines. The world didn’t feel alive, it felt like a tomb, vast and silent and unyielding. And in it, Vera was just another small, fragile thing, clinging to the edge of existence.

She looked down, her breath visible even through the mask of her suit. The building’s edge disappeared into the darkness, and for a moment, she wondered what she was looking for. But the thought didn’t hold. It was swallowed by the cold, the silence, the endless, unchanging stillness of a world that had forgotten how to tell its stories.  
Vera's thoughts echoed in the stillness, and she mused  
  
*"Objects don’t grieve. They just… outwait us"*  
*"Why do things linger when the hands that made them don’t?"*  
*"Is it mercy this endless cold? Or punishment… for outlasting what we were?"*  
*"...What’s colder? The ice… or the silence of a world that leaves no stories?"*

Her internal echoes faded as her boots finally touched the ice once again, the crunch of her steps a solitary sound in the vast stillness. Even as the blizzard raged above, the world below felt quiet—as though the cold had absorbed every sound.


---

““Moji, scan ahead,” she said, steady but weary. “And slow down, Jiji!”  

The drone paused, its light steady on the path ahead.  

“Abandoned house ahead,” Momo reported, its tone calm and detached. “Light snowfall here, but the snowpack above the cliff is unstable.”

Vera’s heart quickened. This was the first remnant she’d found that she could safely explore. She moved cautiously, her boots crunching against the ice.

“Be careful on your right,” Jiji warned late, making Vera step on uneven rocks .  

_**WARNING DELAYED: 8.2 SECONDS. APOLOGIES.EXE NOT FOUND**_

Vera grunt and sigh , she just said  “Momo, scan the surroundings. Jiji, light up the house.”

The drones obeyed, Jiji lights illuminating the small, slumped structure. The roof was caved in, the walls cracked, but it was intact enough to offer shelter from the light snow of this area.. Vera approached the broken window, her gloved hands careful as she climbed through the jagged frame. Inside, the house was frozen in time. Furniture stood rigid, encased in layers of ice. A dining table, its surface cracked; a sofa, its fabric torn and stiff; a television, its screen shattered. Vera’s breath fogged the air as she moved, her footsteps echoing in the silence.Then she saw them books. They were stacked haphazardly on a shelf, their covers frozen, their pages yellowed. She reached out,

“Ovid’s Metamorphoses,” she murmured. “Faust. Thus Spoke Zarathustra… What is this?”

Jiji hovered beside her, its light casting long shadows across the room. “These are books,” it said. “For most of human history, books were humanity’s way of capturing the world in physical form, their thoughts, dreams, and failures.”

Vera turned, her eyes narrowing. “FairTax,” she said, her voice tinged with disbelief. “Is this their dream as well?”

JIji  responded. “Well, to some extent, it’s not limited to fantasy or history, parody, or even tax policy. It’s all in books.”

Vera stared at the books, her expression unreadable. They were fragments of a world that no longer existed, remnants of lives that had been lived and lost.

Momo’s voice cut through the silence. “No signs of life or corpses in this area. Warning: avalanche in five minutes.”

  
Vera stood silently by the window, her gloved hand reaching out with cautious slowness. The glass,lay fragmented and frozen, its remnants clinging to the frame. As her fingers made contact, the fragile pane responded with a faint crack, the sound echoing softly in the stillness of the abandoned house. The world outside was a blur of swirling snow and ice. Through the broken windows, momo still scanning the surrounding area .Jiji, meanwhile, hovered silently above Vera, waiting for her next move.

Suddenly, Momo's voice broke the silence, urgent yet calm. "1 minute…."

Vera's gaze lingered on the cracked glass for a moment before she turned away, her expression resolute. "…alright, let's go," she said, her voice steady and decisive.

With that, she moved swiftly  .

  
_Vera walked through the endless expanse of frozen sand dunes. The world stretched out before her… an infinite grave, miles after miles of nothingness. **Miles after miles after miles after ■■■■■■■■■■.** Beside her, Momo and Jiji moved silently._their lights dimmed to conserve power, their hum a steady accompaniment to the howling wind.

Then, in the distance, something broke the monotony of the horizon a straight, unbroken line of steel and wood, half-buried in the snow. Vera squinted, It was a railroad, the tracks gleaming faintly where the storm had cleared them.

“Moji, scan the tracks,” she said, her voice low and tired.

“Clear.” Momo replied. “No obstructions in range.”

They followed the railroad for what felt like hours, the rhythmic crunch of vera footsteps and the occasional creak of the tracks the only sounds in the vast silence. The storm began to clear, just enough to reveal the skeletal remains of  bridges in the distance. Its supports were shattered, pans broken and hanging in despair.

Moji “ no life detected” .  
  
Vera climbed to the second bridge, the rails guiding her through the relentless storm. The tracks curved sharply, then disappeared beneath a wall of snow and ice. A tunnel entrance had collapsed, leaving only the arched roof of a train protruding a relic with exposed, rust-crusted metal ribs.

Momo scanned the mound.  Organic residue detected. Correction: Scan inconclusive.**" No life detected. “”

Jiji circled the exposed roof, light glinting off frost-sealed windows. "Train model: Pre-Collapse cargo transport. Modified for passenger transit." It paused before adding "Modification appears… improvised."
  
Wiping sweat from her brow , her glove smearing grime across her face. Vera muttered *“Another dead end. Another empty relic.”* The tunnel was nothing more than rubble and snow; the train, a fossil trapped under ice.

Momo pivoted, sensors humming. “Fast scanning perimeter.” After a brief pause, it continued, “Massive structure detected. 800 meters northeast.”

Jiji angled its camera. "Clarify."
“Concrete. Steel. Layout matches urban infrastructure,” Momo reported.

"Show me." Vera ordered, her tone edged with reluctant hope.  

In response, Momo’s light flickered before projecting a hologram a skeletal outline of collapsed towers and iced-over roads. The vision revealed a city, or what remained of it, its buildings stripped down to empty frames and streets choked by snow drifts.

"No energy signatures. No movement." Momo clarify

“Of course not,” Vera muttered as she stared at the ruins.

Momo’s light flickered. "Proceed?"
Vera didn’t answer. She stepped past the drones, her boots carving fresh tracks toward the city.  
  
  
The highway was choked with vehicles. Cars sat bumper-to-bumper under ice, windshields frosted opaque. A semi-truck lay on its side, trailer split open, crates spilling out frozen solid.A faded sign read **NOW LEAVING ■■■■■■■■■■**, the letters cracked, brittle, frozen in time._.Vera stepped over a frozen puddle as ice snapped under her boot.

Momo swept its light across the road. “No organic decay detected. No bodies.”

Jiji hovered near a bus, tires sunk in permafrost. “Vehicle interiors empty. No luggage. No personal items.”

Vera kept walking, shoulders hunched against the wind. The city loomed ahead skyscrapers stripped to steel frames, upper floors sheared off. Ice crusted every surface, 
They passed under a collapsed overpass. Chunks of concrete dangled from exposed rebar. 

Momo’s sensors whirred. “Structural instability: 89%.”

The street narrowed, flanked by sinking skyscrapers .Momo scanned the buildings left and right.Once again, they were too dangerous for Vera to enter  years of exposure to blizz-  
BAM.

Lightning split the sky. Electric blue, jagged, lingering, searing the clouds. It struck a radio tower two blocks east. The structure lit up as wires glowed white-hot before snapping, sparks raining down onto the snow.

_Momo’s lens zoomed. “No life signs confirmed. Archival note: This structure once broadcast 14,302 human communications daily.”
Vera stared at the chair. “Yeah,” she said. “Got it.”_

Jiji pivoted toward the tower. “Recommend avoiding conductive surfaces.”

Vera kept moving. The lightning flashed again, closer now. Iilluminating the street in stark bursts. shadows sharpened into hard lines. She stopped at the base of the tallest skyscraper, its facade pocked with blast marks. A lobby chair sat upright in the snow, cushion rotted to dust.

BAM.

The third strike hit the building’s spire. For a moment, the tower’s skeleton glowed blue, every beam and joint illuminated. Then darkness slammed back.

Momo light flickered. “Scan complete. Conclusion: No survivors. No remains. No traces of recent activity.”

Vera stared at the chair. “Yeah,” she said. “Got it.”

Thunder rolled. The drones fell in behind her as she walked away , the only witnesses left to ask the cold for answers.  
  

They walked away from the city, the storm fading to a steady wind. Hours passed. Ice dunes gave way to a flat, endless white. Vera stopped at the edge of a frozen ocean. Waves stood frozen mid-crash, sharp and still. Beyond them, a glacier towered, its surface cracked and scarred by lightning.

Momo hovered at the ice’s edge. “Deploying underwater form. Estimated dive time: 47 minutes.” It dropped into a crack, vanishing beneath the surface.

Jiji turned toward distant mountains. “Scanning elevated terrain. ETA: 22 minutes.”

Vera sat, her back against a slab of ice. Cold seeped through her suit.
BAM.
Lightning struck the glacier. A thin line glowed where it hit.

Momo’s voice buzzed in her ear. “Lightning impact location recorded. Melt possible in 1–2 days near your position.”

“Momo, status update.”

“10 kilometers deep. 200 meters underwater. Dive time elapsed: 41 minutes. Water temperature: minus one. Near heat vents: 100 to 300. No life detected.”

Vera checked her wrist display. “None?”

“Confirmed. None.”

Another sigh came from Vera . She dropped her body to the snow, and lay back. The sky was flat and dark, no stars, just …..cold .


Silence.  
  

She shut her eyes. The ice groaned under her weight, a low, grinding rumble that vibrated through her bones. Cold seeped into her suit seams, sharp and unrelenting. Her thoughts drifted, untethered.

*What the hell am I searching for* 
A beat of silence. Then static fizzed in her ear.

“There's something going on…” Jiji said

Her eyelids fluttered. She didn’t respond. The wind howling over the glacier, muffling Jiji’s voice.
*Was Omnia right? Was he lying?*

Jiji: “Vera? Vera? You copy?”

Her glove twitched, brushing snow. She stared at the sky, breath fogging the air. *There’s nothing…. just cold, barren dune snow.*

“Vera!” Jiji called urgently.

She jerked, “What? What something?”

Jiji: “It’s an anomaly. Fifty meters out. A sudden burst of energy in a straight line. And it’s 373 km north of you. Momo?”

“Yeah, copy that,” Momo replied.
  
  
The frozen ocean gave way to razorback ridges of ice, their slopes sheer and pocked with crevasses. Vera moved methodically, her boots punching through crusted snow. Momo’s light carved a tunnel through the blizzard ahead, while Jiji’s scans painted a skeletal map on her wrist displaying red lines for drop-offs, blue for stable ice. Her prosthetic arm whirred faintly as it adjusted grip on her climbing axe, joints stiff from the cold.

Ahead, the land fractured into a labyrinth of cliffs. Jiji banked sharply, circling a fissure. “Anomaly’s origin point: 200 meters beyond this ridge.”

Vera nodded, her breath fogging her eyes. “Then we go through it.”

  
Vera followed Jiji’s coordinates north, the drones flanking her. The terrain dropped into a maze of ice cliffs, their edges jagged and slick.

Vera  “Jiji, scan ahead.” she instructed.

Jiji surged forward, its light carving a path through the gloom. . As Vera rappelled down, her matte-black prosthetic arm dug into the ice, sending sparks flying where metal met frozen rock.

“Right side,” Momo reported, its beam illuminating vera boots . 

Vera adjusted her descent silently.

“Cliff ahead three to five meters,” Momo continued.

She landed hard, knees buckling. A fissure gaped at her feet, its edges brittle.

“Light the path,” she commanded.

Momo’s spotlight fixed on the far wall. Vera backed up, her pulse syncing with the muffled tick-tick-tick of her suit’s internal clock. Hydraulics hissed in her prosthetic arm as pressure built like a semi-truck gearing for a haul. Bending low, her boots dug into the snow.

Tick.
Her muscles coiled.
Tick.
The prosthetic’s joints whined, pistons priming.
Tick.
She ran. Ice cracked under her sprint. The crevasse yawned. She leapt-  
  
Her boot skidded on black ice. In an instant, Momo’s claw snapped out, clamping her forearm, its motors whining as it hauled her onto solid ground.

Vera: “Thanks, Momo.”

Momo: “Be careful.”

  
Sliding down again Vera finally caught sight of Jiji and something massive ahead….


light revealed something massive ahead a cylinder lodged diagonally in the ice. Thick as a subway tunnel, its surface shimmered with a sickly green film, like oil on water. No smell. No heat signature. Just... there.

“What? What is that?” she asked.

Jiji hovered closer. “Diameter: 18 meters. Length unknown. Material and entity name remain unidentified.”

“Entity? What do you mean?” Vera pressed.

A low hum vibrated through the ice as the mysterious object rippled. “It’s pulsing,” Jiji observed.

“Pulsing? So this thing is alive?” she gulp . 

“Don’t go below—it could be hazardous material,” Momo cautioned, angling between her and the cylinder.

“Pulse rate: steady at 50 per minute. Unusual for a creature this size,” Jiji added.

Vera stepped closer, watching as the entity throbbed, light diffusing in waves along its surface. Momo’s beam traced a path along the cylinder’s curve.

“Pulse grows stronger in this direction,” Momo reported.

“Let’s follow it,” Vera said, securing her grip on the ice axe
  
The storm worsened as they pushed forward, following the pulsing entity. Lightning struck every few seconds, blue-white flashes searing the ice into Vera’s retinas. She ignored the collapsed buildings, hollowed-out trucks, and a subway station buried beneath glaciers , none of it mattered. Only the pulse.

When they reached the source, the blizzard suddenly stilled. They slid down toward what appeared to be creatures.

“Scanning ahead,” came a combined report from Momo and Jiji.

“Feather…?” Vera asked, watching in disbelief as feathers floated above, defying gravity.

Jiji replied, “There are five entities surrounding one central one.”

Momo continued, “Total height unknown; it has two limb-like legs and appears to be chained. Scan failed , the snow depth exceeds one kilometer, and the gap measurement is disrupted by the entity.”  

Vera observed two massive legs, thick and anchored by chains, while the creature’s upper body vanished into the storm’s ceiling. A spear the size of a tower pierced the mass, leaving gaping holes where metal had torn through.

“Is that a heart?” Vera confuse 

Jiji responded, “Not beating, approximately 30 m wide. It seems to have an object piercing it, creating holes through the heart.”  
A second report came in: “Has multiple wings, unknown type, wrapped in chains as well.” The wings, feathered and fractured, splayed from its... back or front—each bound by hundreds of smaller chains.

Static screeched as Momo drifted higher toward the creature’s obscured upper half.

_Static screeched as Momo drifted higher toward the creature’s obscured upper half.  
“Momo? Mo■■■? ■■■■■■■■■■—”
Vera couldn’t move. Her lungs locked. Lungs locked lungs locked lungs ■■■■■■■■■■_
. She is right below this creature,, The heart’s glass sphere reflected nothing, just black voids where the ■■■■holes bored straight down into the ice. Vertical. Endless. Her pupils dilated, straining to see into them, but there was no bottom, no edge, just a hunger that pulled at her gut.

Then, as the tension spiked, Jiji scream, “Back off!”

Momo’s alarm signaled, “!”

She jerked, stumbled. The drones wrenched her arms, dragging her backward. The slope’s edge crumbled under her boots.

Momo’s sensors quickly updated: “Detecting an increase in feathers!”

Vera’s hand wouldn’t stop shaking. She clamped it over her chest, fingernails biting through her suit.

Jiji’s voice cut through the mounting chaos: “Acoustic anomaly detected. Frequency matches… a heartbeat.”

Gasping, her vision tunneling, Vera managed, “Wait… that’s not mine. Jiji, what did Corvin say again?”

“Four paths stretch toward the heavens, yet only one leads to truth. The path before the spear is where silence reveals all,” Jiji recited.

“Is there one of the green entities in front of the spear?” Vera pressed.

“Yes,” Jiji confirmed.

“Fuck! Run!” she shouted.

The creature didn’t move. No twitch, no roar. Just_The heartbeat thud… thud… thud ■■■■■■■■■■_ pounding through the ice, through her boots, through her skull. The pressure built like a vise, her own ribs creaking as if her heart might rupture.

They ran as fast as they could, desperately climbing out of the cliff. The blizzard roared back; wind hurled ice grit that scraped Vera’s face. Keeping her head low, she squinted through the storm as they followed the pulsing green entity. Lightning struck the cliffs around them, each flash bleaching the landscape into bone-white snow. Momo led the way, scanning for drop-offs, while Jiji trailed behind, sensors flaring erratically.

BAM.

A strike shattered the ridge above. Debris rained down rocks, ice shards, splintered steel. Vera ducked, boots skidding as the avalanche thundered past. She didn’t look back. Neither did the drones.

Above the cliff, the spear-pierced heart shuddered. Its glass surface rippled, fractures rearranging into a dark, pupil-like void. The sphere tightened into an eye massive, unblinking. It observed their retreat. 

---

Miles later, the ground leveled into a cracked riverbed. The entity had vanished, swallow by the fog  .
  

Jiji slowed, its rotors stuttering. Its status light blinked as it transmitted: 
[PriorityChannel_Request] [EncryptionKey: JIJI-0774 → JIJI-0774] [Subject: DataPacket_IntegrityCheck]

Momo (rapid beep sequence): [RequestReceived] [VerifyingCredentials…]

Jiji: [ResendPacket_Y/N?]

Momo: [Affirmative] [AccessGranted]

Jiji: “Anomaly detected. Rear quadrant.”

Momo swung around. “Scanning… No movement. No heat signatures.”

Jiji: “It was there. For 0.3 seconds.”

Momo: “Negative. Sensor logs show—”

Before the exchange could continue, Vera interjected, “What’s wrong, Momo?”

For a moment, the drones went silent, their lights tracing overlapping circles on the ice. Then Momo’s steady green pulse conveyed:  
[DataStream_End] [EncryptionKey_Expired] [Channel_Closing]

Jiji emitted a double beep:  
[Acknowledged] [TerminatingLink]

Finally, Momo stated simply, “…Nothing.”

Vera stared into the storm, the cold needling the back of her neck. The wind howled.

“Recommend proceeding. Cold-front intensifying,” Jiji advised.

They moved on, leaving behind the lingering eyethe unblinking gaze that drilled into the storm.
  

They walked for two days. The entity’s pulse led them through ice fields that never changed.

Momo: “Distance covered: 200 miles. Elapsed time: 48 hours.”

Vera’s glove brushed against empty air before coming to an abrupt halt. Her fingers spread against nothing, then pressed harder against an unseen resistanc cold and hard . Ahead, the snow swirled as usual, yet her hand hovered midair as if braced against a sheet of glass.

“What the hell…?” she murmured.

Momo ascended, its thrusters whining. At about 30 meters up, it stopped—its light reflecting off an invisible surface. Meanwhile, Jiji drilled downward; sparks flew as its drill bit ground against the same barrier.

“Look at these giant glass walls!” Vera exclaimed.

“Measurement failed. Likely encircles the entire area,” Jiji replied.

the green entity ahead rippled, passing through the wall like normal landscape . Vera clenched her lips and, breathing hard, called out, “Momo, help me crack this one!”

Her left arm shuddered servos whirring as plates shifted. Reinforced alloy segments locked into place, exposing plasma coils that glowed dull orange. A fuel port hissed open near her elbow.

“Affirmative. Engaging 40-year fuel reserve,” Momo stated.

Both drones clamped onto her shoulder as fuel lines snaked into the port. The coils flared white-hot, and fire engulfed her arm swirling from fingertips to shoulder in a contained inferno fueled by Momo’s injected hydrogen.

“More! Reserve only one year’s fuel!” Vera growled through gritted teeth.

A pause. Momo’s joints hissed, throttling the flow.

After a brief pause, Momo’s joints hissed as they throttled the flow. “…Request accepted,” it replied.

“Acknowledged,” added Jiji.

The fire then condensed into a spear-like beam. Vera swung her arm forward with all her might. The wall screeched as ice and metal vaporized on contact, and the barrier rippled with cracks spider-webbing outward.

“Damn, barely broke it!” she shouted, strain sharpening her voice.

The breach hissed with molten edges, now two meters wide. Vera squeezed through, her suit steaming as the furnace-like blast met the bitter cold on the other side.

Her thermal readout spiked red 140°C, then 160, then 190.

“Atmospheric shift critical. Suit integrity at 43%,” Momo announced.

“Gravitational anomalies detected. Local physics… inconsistent,” Jiji added.

The world here resembled a forge. Molten rivers carved through black rock while above, floating islands of jagged stone hovered, dripping lava into the void. The sky was a starless dark—no fog, no blizzard—only relentless lightning. Red-orange bolts, thicker than skyscrapers, lashed the horizon. Each strike lingered for minutes, clawing across the blackness like glowing scars.

Choking on the searing heat as her suit struggled to adjust, Vera gasped, “What is this…?”

“No match to known astral charts,” Momo replied. “Radiation spikes suggest non-local spacetime.”

Jiji interjected, “Entities detected. Same classification as prior. *_Same classification as future. Same classification as ■■■■■■■■■■.”_

They were everywhere winged shapes, colossal yet indistinct, gliding between the islands. There were no chains, no spears. Just shadows wreathed in heat-haze, their enormous wings warping the air like shifting mirages.

Then, a red-orange lightning strike froze mid-arc. In its afterglow, a creature materialized three meters to Vera’s left. Its wings were folded tight around its body—a cocoon of charred feathers and shifting void. Waves of heat radiated off it, warping Momo’s sensors into static.

Another lightning strike followed. The bolt lingered, its red-orange light etching the creature’s silhouette into the air—a figure of jagged angles and hollows, with wings that swallowed all reflection.
